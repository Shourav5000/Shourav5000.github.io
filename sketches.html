                <p> This is a fun anime platform for both anime artists who want some advice on how to get started and for individuals       who like anime in general.<br><br>
                    My purpose here is to show my art work and share my understanding of the anime world I have known and also to motivate the young & old to do what they love and keep purpusing them. Especially when it's art, because art is beautiful. 
                    Feel free to me away for any help regarding art & anime. Share your thoughts and understanding.
                </p>
